# Cam-Phishing-in-Cybersecurity
This project explores camphishing, a sophisticated form of phishing that manipulates
individuals into revealing sensitive information through social engineering tactics. As cyber
threats evolve, camphishing has become increasingly prevalent, posing significant risks to
both individuals and organizations. The project aims to define camphishing, analyze its
techniques and impacts, and develop effective detection and prevention strategies. Through
a comprehensive literature review, case studies, and stakeholder surveys, we identify the
limitations of existing cybersecurity measures and propose targeted solutions, including
awareness programs and policy recommendations.
